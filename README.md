Assignment 02 - the 2nd step of the huge one
===================

Modify your works in the **Assignment 01** to extend its functionality. Replace original `add()` and `subtract()` with corresponded operators. Please implement all following relational and arithmetic operations with huge integers: `=, ==, !=, <, >, +, -, *, /, %, <<,` all of this op are **Binary** operators (<< is made for outputting)


+Use dynamic array or std::vector to obtain higher scores (+20pts). And, use provided driver program (**main_hw2.cpp**) to test your work. 
NOTE: No floating point and negative value required. All values should be positive integer (include Zero) - **(Due date: 4/15)**

(Please refer to example_HugeUInteger_hw2.h)
```C++
#define MAX 1000 //< max length of huge interger
class HugeUInteger 
{
	friend ostream &operator<<(ostream &output, const HugeUInteger &in);
public:
	HugeUInteger(); //< default constructor (the default value = 0)
	HugeUInteger(HugeUInteger &in); //< copy constructor
	static HugeUInteger random(unsigned int size); //< randomly generate an integer, 
	                                               //< the highest digit should not be ZERO
	static HugeUInteger zero(); //< generate a zero number (size = 1)
	HugeUInteger operator=(const HugeUInteger &right); //< assignment
	bool operator==(const HugeUInteger &right); //< equal to
	bool operator!=(const HugeUInteger &right); //< not equal to
	bool operator<(const HugeUInteger &right);  //< less than
	bool operator>(const HugeUInteger &right);  //< greater than
	
	HugeUInteger operator+(const HugeUInteger &right);
	//< addition operator; HugeUInteger + HugeUInteger
	HugeUInteger  operator-(const HugeUInteger &right);
	//< subtraction operator; HugeUInteger  - HugeUInteger ;
	//< (Use ZERO to replace negative result)
	HugeUInteger  operator*(const HugeUInteger &right);
	//< multiplication operator; HugeUInteger  * HugeUInteger 
	HugeUInteger  operator/(const HugeUInteger &right);
	//< division operator; HugeUInteger  / HugeUInteger 
	HugeUInteger  operator%(const HugeUInteger &right);
	//< modulus operator; HugeUInteger  % HugeUInteger

private:
///add something to stores a huge integer (dynamic array or std::vector or Â¡K)
///add some helper functions
};
```

Sample outputs

>Enter seed: **13**

>Enter the lengths of three huge integers: **7 8 9**

>N1: 1962866

>N2: 93543033

>N3: 720778699

>N4: 0

>N1 + N3 = 722741565

>(negative)N2 - N3 = 0

>N1 * N4 = 0

>N4 = N2 + N3 * N1 = 1414792095334367

----------
A common workflow of preparation of your homework (UPDATED)
-------------
(In the following text, we assume your student ID is s1234567 and # is the NUMBER of homework in one digit, Please replace it with your student ID and follow the steps exactly!)


1. Clone your private repository of hw# to your home directory on server or another suitable location from our organization on GitHub (https://github.com/YZU-CSE-CS114-Computer-Programming-II)


2. After you start to deal with your homework, add a file s1234567hw#_main.cpp as your main program and s1234567hw#_report.md as your report (optional). Then, commit it! **(Don't forget to push it onto GitHub, too)** 
**Any of your code should be prefixed with "1234567hw#_"**.
**For example: s1234567hw3_ HugeUInteger.h, s1234567hw3_ HugeUInteger.cpp**


3. Complete your program and write your report (if necessary) with Markdown.
*. Please commit your homework when you have any progress.


4. Make sure you have complete the assignment and prepare a clear demo in your report. **Do it ON YOUR OWN and ON TIME.** (You have **only 2 chances in this semester** to request additional time for doing your homework, each chance will give you additional **24Hours**. Please contact the TAs **BEFORE** the deadline and use it wisely)
